# GenInfoSync-Project

## Overview
GenInfoSync-Project is an automation initiative aimed at efficiently submitting gene data into Bangladesh's inaugural genetic disease database. This project comprises three Python scripts designed to streamline the collection, submission, and verification of genetic information within the database.

## Functionalities
- **Data Collection Script:** The initial script gathers information for eight essential fields required to complete a gene information submission form.
- **Submission Script:** The second script automates the process of entering collected data into the genetic disease database via web automation techniques.
- **Verification Script:** The final script verifies and identifies missing gene entries in the database, ensuring comprehensive data integrity.

## Accomplishments
This project successfully submitted gene details for 3,143 out of 3,744 available genes in the server, significantly expediting the data submission process and ensuring a more comprehensive genetic database for research and analysis.

## Efficiency Comparison
The completion of data collection and submission for 3,143 genes was accomplished within 27-29 hours of runtime. Manual submission by an individual would demand approximately 374 to 426 hours or 16 to 18 days of continuous work, assuming a minimum of 7-8 minutes per gene for data collection and submission.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Selenium: Employed for web browsing automation, enabling streamlined data entry.
  - Requests: Utilized for API integration, facilitating the shortening of lengthy URLs.

## Impact
GenInfoSync-Project significantly streamlines the process of gene data submission, minimizing human labor and expediting the creation of an extensive genetic disease database for researchers and practitioners.

**Note:** The runtime duration is subject to variation based on internet speed, independent of the specificities of the PC.

## Accessing the Project
The scripts utilized for this project are available on GitHub for further examination and reference.

## Website
The genetic disease database can be accessed at: [BGDD - SUST](https://bgdd.sust.edu/)

This project demonstrates the efficacy of automation in accelerating data processing tasks, particularly in the realm of genetic research and database management.
